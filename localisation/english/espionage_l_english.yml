espionage_mission_undecided:0 "No Current Mission Avaliable"
espionage_mission_1_assassinate:0 "§YOfficer Assassination§!\nAn undercover agent in the [?targeted_country_slot_1.GetName] has provided us with the travel plans for a high-ranking officer. We've already dispatched a bounty hunter to make quick work of the officer."
espionage_mission_1_ransom:0 "§YOfficer Ransom§!\nWe have recently discovered a resort frequented by the military officers from the [?targeted_country_slot_1.GetName] for rest and recuperation. With so many important people going back and forth, it'd be a shame if one were to go missing..."
espionage_mission_1_training:0 "§YArmy Training§!\nBounty Hunters are incredibly flexible, tactically. They know how to act in small, independent groups and plan ambushes from almost anywhere. Our commanders and soldiers could use this information, and the Bounty Hunters have agreed to teach them."
espionage_mission_1_intimidate_senator:0 "§YIntimidate Senator§!\nThe word on the street is a senator from the [?targeted_country_slot_1.GetName] has been partaking in socially reprehensible acts in private. This isn't something we care about, but the way the Senator has been voting is a problem. With the right words, we could solve this problem..."
espionage_mission_1_cyber_attack:0 "§YCyber Attack§!\nOur slicers have found a terminal in [?targeted_country_slot_1.GetName] to have weak encryption. While the terminal itself is rather unimportant, it has connections to defence terminals. With some exploitation, this could lead to disaster for our target."
espionage_mission_1_steal_blueprint:0 "§YSteal Blueprint§!\nA Research lab in [?targeted_country_slot_1.GetName] has sent blueprints to be developed into prototypes, luckily for us, they are cutting costs and using improperly defended transportation. An agent could simply slip it, take the blueprints, and disappear."
espionage_mission_1_sprout_disease:0 "§YSprout Disease§!\nA virus has been discovered that only prospers in the atmosphere found on [?targeted_country_slot_1.GetName], releasing this in a capital city could potentially cause a planetwide pandemic and untold costs. Consider the consequences carefully."
espionage_mission_1_logisitics:0 "§YLogistics Sabotage§!\nThrough a mix of direct sabotage and swapping labels, our agents can cause a massive headache for [?targeted_country_slot_1.GetName] when it's discovered that their equipment is faulty and barely functioning."
espionage_mission_1_sabotage_target:0 "§YIndustrial Sabotage§!\nIt's very clear that [?targeted_country_slot_1.GetName]'s industry is it's beating heart. A few screw loose, some parameters removed, and we can cause mass chaos in their factories."
espionage_mission_1_infilitrate_military:0 "§YInfiltrate Military§!\nIt seems we have a turncoat. A high ranking officer in [?targeted_country_slot_1.GetName] has offered to allow us access to important military data, in exchange for safety and impunity once the war is over."
espionage_mission_1_undermine_guild:0 "§YUndermine Guild§!\nThe relationship in [?targeted_country_slot_1.GetName] between government and the guilds is an everchanging one. Perhaps, with a bit of a nudge, we can widen divsion between them and remove another ally from [?targeted_country_slot_1.GetName]."
espionage_mission_1_capital_ship:0 "§YDestroy Capital Ship§!\nDespite the danger of it, we could sneak an elite commando squad onto a [?targeted_country_slot_1.GetName] capital ship via a hijacked transport craft. The squad would then move down to the lower levels, and set the ship to blow after their timely departure."
espionage_mission_1_steal_equipment:0 "§YSteal Equipment§!\nIt would our spies have located some guards in [?targeted_country_slot_1.GetName] who have been slacking off. Of course, this would be a terrible thing to have happen... a small squad could easily break in and steal military supplies with little risk of being caught."
espionage_mission_1_smuggle_slaves:0 "§YSmuggle Slaves§!\nWithin [?targeted_country_slot_1.GetName] controlled space, there is a slave trading hub. Slaves are never cheap to buy, but money wouldn't be an issue if we were to hijack an incoming or disembarking convoy loaded with slaves just fresh for the taking..."
espionage_mission_1_set_slaves_free:0 "§YFree Slaves§!\nWithin [?targeted_country_slot_1.GetName] controlled space, there is a slave trading hub. Keeping slaves isn't our cup of caf, but if we were to hijack a convoy, the slaves would be ever grateful, and we would welcome them to freedom."
espionage_mission_1_provoke_slave_revolt:0 "§YProvoke Slave Revolt§!\n[?targeted_country_slot_1.GetName]'s slavetrade is abhorrent! However, [?targeted_country_slot_1.GetName] should know that keeping such a large number of unhappy people with so little defenses is a bad idea. If we were to supply them weapons, the slaves would surely rise up."
espionage_mission_1_arming_dissidents:0 "§YArm Dissidents§!\nWhile they may not agree with us entirely, many within [?targeted_country_slot_1.GetName] have issues with the government. Issues that they wish to take out violently. Perhaps we should give them a few... tools to properly convey their emotions."
espionage_mission_1_plant_sleeper_agent:0 "§YPlant Sleeper Agent§!\nAn agent we placed within [?targeted_country_slot_1.GetName] has finally rose through the ranks and been assigned a high-ranking position. To not take advantage of an opportunity like this would be a mistake."
espionage_mission_1_reroute_supply:0 "§YReroute Supply§!\nSupply lines are long and often times go through multiple forms of transportation and cargo inspections. If we were to take control of some out of the way infrastructure, we could reroute or seize equipment to ensure it never reaches the frontlines."
espionage_mission_1_market_crash:0 "§YMarket Crash§!\nA bank in [?targeted_country_slot_1.GetName] has been picked up on by our local slicers as a major economic target. With some resources put toward it, our slicers may be able to get through a back door and cause the local market to crash."
espionage_mission_2_assassinate:0 "§YOfficer Assassination§!\nA implanted agent in the [?targeted_country_slot_2.GetName] has gained access to route plans of a high ranking officer of theirs. A bounty hunter in that area could result easily in their death."
espionage_mission_2_ransom:0 "§YOfficer Ransom§!\nWe have recently discovered a resort used frequently by the [?targeted_country_slot_2.GetName] for rest and recuperation. Agents posing as tourist would be able to sneak in and out with lets say, a body in their luggage."
espionage_mission_2_training:0 "§YArmy Training§!\nOur commanders could very much benefit from teachings from our bounty hunters in small unit tactics and ambushes. A training regime has already been drafted and is awaiting your approval."
espionage_mission_2_intimidate_senator:0 "§YIntimidate Senator§!\nA Senator from the [?targeted_country_slot_2.GetName] has been found to be partaking in immoral pleasures, a threat there and a hint of it being revealed will place them in our pocket."
espionage_mission_2_cyber_attack:0 "§YCyber Attack§!\nOur technicians have discovered relatively undefended research centre in [?targeted_country_slot_2.GetName] studying biology, while they are unimportant their connections to defence research centres means a explotition through their network would result in catastrophe."
espionage_mission_2_steal_blueprint:0 "§YSteal Blueprint§!\nA Research department in [?targeted_country_slot_2.GetName] has sent sensitive documents to be disposed of, luckily for us, they are cutting costs and hiring a new disposal service. Agents posing as garbage collecters can collect these documents and walk out the front door."
espionage_mission_2_sprout_disease:0 "§YSprout Disease§!\nNew breakthroughs in disease have developed a airborne virus only capable of reproducing in [?targeted_country_slot_2.GetName] gas concentrations, releasing this in a capital city could cause tens of thousands of casualties. The proposal is on your desk."
espionage_mission_2_logisitics:0 "§YLogistics Sabotage§!\nBy altering quality control on producers of military weapons in [?targeted_country_slot_2.GetName], we can introduce thousands of dud equipment while scrapping good equipment. They will drive themselves insane looking at their equipment without realising the true problem."
espionage_mission_2_sabotage_target:0 "§YIndustrial Sabotage§!\nConstant probing of incident response times in [?targeted_country_slot_2.GetName] have shown their responses to be lacking in certain areas. A chemical agent designed to sew panic and destruction has been already smuggled and ready to use in a key government factory."
espionage_mission_2_infilitrate_military:0 "§YInfiltrate Military§!\nLocal agents have made contact with a high ranking official in [?targeted_country_slot_2.GetName] who seems to be receptive to our style of government. Promises of safety and a new life after a time of providing info would allow us information on troop movements."
espionage_mission_2_undermine_guild:0 "§YUndermine Guild§!\nIn [?targeted_country_slot_2.GetName] divisions are forming between government and guild contacts, damning evidence placed at a few crime scenes at government offices will assuredly cause further division between them."
espionage_mission_2_capital_ship:0 "§YDestroy Capital Ship§!\nA captured military transport has recently been captured complete with authorisation codes, using this transport we can sneak a commando squad into a starbase and set demolition charges on a capital ship."
espionage_mission_2_steal_equipment:0 "§YSteal Equipment§!\nContact has been established with a logistics officer in [?targeted_country_slot_2.GetName] who is willing to let some equipment go stolen in return for some civilian goods we have on hand already."
espionage_mission_2_smuggle_slaves:0 "§YSmuggle Slaves§!\nDroid Probes have been watching a major hub for slave transport in [?targeted_country_slot_2.GetName], a major convoy is onroute to pass through this hub. A strike team has been assembled to capture this convoy and with the slaves for our own use."

espionage_mission_2_arming_dissidents:0 "§YArm Dissidents§!\nWith recent conquests in [?targeted_country_slot_2.GetName] they are having no lack of dissidents willing to cause chaos, air drops from small craft would be able to bring sorely needed supplies causing increases in targets."
espionage_mission_2_plant_sleeper_agent:0 "§YPlant Sleeper Agent§!\nA family we implanted into [?targeted_country_slot_2.GetName] has recently bore fruit with them becoming high in government administration, now we can commit greater resources and target them more if that is your desire."
