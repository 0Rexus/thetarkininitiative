 ZER_blitzer_harrsk_desc:0 "Blitzer Harrsk was one of the most talented tacticians in the Imperial Navy. During the Battle of Endor, Harrsk suffered a cranial injury resulting in a split personality between Harrsk and his deceased second-in-command Captain Bolla Thoath. Following the destruction of the death star, Harrsk, who was convinced he was Bolla Thoath, initially complied with Captain Gilad Pellaeon's retreat orders. Harrsk later emerged from his second personality and refused to obey orders from such a low rank imperial.\n\nIn the past 2 years since the Emperor was killed, Harrsk has carved out the an empire in the Deep Core using his fleet of modified star destroyers. The self-proclaimed Lord High Admiral Harrsk now looks to expand the influence of the Zero Command and forge a new Empire in the ashes of a dying one."

 # EVENTS # 

 ZER.1.t:0 "Zero Command Fleet Modifications?"
 ZER.1.d:0 "Never before has Zero Command faced more external threats! Lord High Admiral Harrsk requires a more powerful fleet in order to protect our territories from potential enemies. We have two feasible options; we could either technologically enhance our current ships, or set about creating an efficient production line for new warships. A technologically advanced fleet enjoys precision in tactics, low losses, and high impact on the battlefield. A larger, standardised fleet enjoys strength in numbers and less material loss when a fleet is destroyed. The choice is up to you commander."
 ZER.1.a:0 "A technologically enhanced fleet will give us the advantage."
 ZER.1.b:0 "Zero Command requires more warships to defend itself."

 ZER.2.t:0 "Robotic Tie Fighters"
 ZER.2.d:0 "Our scientists have been experimenting with robotically assisted Tie Fighters, although they have been extremely effective at targeting enemies and navigating obstacles, the pilots usually have to intervene as the tests have shown but if this technology succeeds, it could give us the edge over our enemy. Final tests will determine whether the technology is battle-ready or not."
 ZER.2.a:0 "I'm hoping for results..."

 ZER.3.t:0 "Testing Failure"
 ZER.3.d:0 "The testing Tie Fighters were unable to pass the course provided by the researchers, the project has been terminated but some valuable experience has been gained by many of the fleet technicians."
 ZER.3.a:0 "It was a crazy idea anyways!"

 ZER.4.t:0 "Testing Success"
 ZER.4.d:0 "Miraculously the tests were all passed by the robotic Tie Fighters, although this technology will not be used to fully control spacecraft it will be implemented in newer models of Tie Fighter to improve the pilot's accuracy and provide a competent autopilot."
 ZER.4.a:0 "Let's hope our enemies don't find this."

 ZER.5.t:0 "Shockwave Battle-ready"
 ZER.5.d:0 "Shockwave has been completely sealed with all new additions fixed to the warship. The destroyer must go through a series of inspections before being implemented. Lord High Admiral Harrsk is elated with the completion of this project and is keen to unveil the machine of war to the public."
 ZER.5.a:0 "Excellent!"

 ZER.6.t:0 "Shockwave Revealed to the Public"
 ZER.6.d:0 "The technologically advanced star destroyer Shockwave was revealed to the public today amidst a military parade. The behemoth of a warship hovered peacefully in the sky above rows of marching stormtroopers. Looks of amazement and astonishment were seen on the citizens's faces as they looked up to such a sight."
 ZER.6.a:0 "A most powerful weapon."
