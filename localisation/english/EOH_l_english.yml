Many years later, Thrawn's strategic brilliance propelled the establishment and maintenance of Sidious' New Order. Yet The Emperor knew just as well as his trusty Grand Admiral that the menaces hidden in the depths of the Unknown Regions would not keep quiet for much longer and so sent Thrawn on a secret mission to establish a powerful imperial presence in the Unknown Regions: a hidden empire. Now, the Emperor is dead. The grand gate defending the strength of the new order has been struck down and the traitorous rebels are storming into the breach. Will you defeat the enemies of the new order both within the Unknown Regions and without? Will you be the heir to the Empire?"
