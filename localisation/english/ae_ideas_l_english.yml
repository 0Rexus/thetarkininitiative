 PEN_velcar_free_commerce_zone_desc:0 "The Velcar Free Commerce Zone (FCZ) was an autonomous region of the Outer Rim. It was a corporate state controlled by Commerce Master Commissioners, many representing business interests. Many primitive species inhabited the planets of the Zone, and were essentially enslaved as indentured laborers by the Commerce Commissioners. During Imperial times it was located in Oversector Outer, and was under the influence of first Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin, then his successor, Ardus Kaine."
