 #Decisions
 PEN_pirate_activity_category:0 "Pentastar Space: Pirate Activity"
 PEN_pirate_activity_category_desc:0 "With the formation of the Pentastar Alignment several criminal groups have increased their activities in Pentastar space.\n\nOne figure in particular stands out amongst the rogues, an Entrallan named Roark Slader. Previously an honourable militiaman, Roark has, since the Alignment arrived, strayed into crime and become a key figure in criminal, pirate networks.\n\nEven though it is hard to admit, the pirates have proven to be effective raiders and if we fail to respond effectively the pirate threat may grow to become uncontrollable."
