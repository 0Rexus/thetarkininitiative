The Empire he now rules over, however, is fractured, and his authority is weak. His authority is challenged by former Moffs and Admirals who have declared themselves Warlords of the Empire. Only time will tell how long his Empire will last..."

The purpose of this is council, he has declared, is to formalize the primary function of the Empire. Since the death of Emperor Palpatine, the Empire has become fractured, and Pestage wishes to prevent further division by allowing all those leaders still loyal to the New Order to have a say in the Empire's future. \n\nThree proposals have been made:\nFirst, by Admiral Zsinj, who proposes that all imperial states should fund the self-declared Warlords as their primary means of defence.\nSecond, by Grand Moff Ardus Kaine, who proposes that Imperial states adopt a common trade policy.\nThird, by Grand Admiral Thrawn, who proposes that research be subsidized and the main priority of the Empire.\n\nHow do we stand?"
