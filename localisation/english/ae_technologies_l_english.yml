 ion_cannon_technology_1:0 "Basic Ion Cannons"
 ion_cannon_technology_1_desc:0 "Ion cannons vary in size and strength, but the most basic function of one is to fire an ionized shot that will interfere with electrical systems. This can be used to short circuit or disable shields, weapon systems, and even entire ships."
 ion_cannon_technology_2:0 "Improved Ion Cannons"
 ion_cannon_technology_2_desc:0 "New technological advancements have allowed us to tighten the beam accuracy of our Ion cannons, as well as strengthening the ionization capabilities of the weapon to up combat capabilities."
 ion_cannon_technology_3:0 "Advanced Ion Cannons"
 ion_cannon_technology_3_desc:0 "Even further work on our ionization tech allow us equip our ships with pin-point accurate Ion cannons. The Ion cannons will now have self-repair capabilities, as well as being able to assist the gunner or gunner AI in faster, more accurate aiming."
 laser_cannon_technology_1:0 "Basic Laser Cannons"
 laser_cannon_technology_1_desc:0 "Laser Cannons have been used for millennia. The idea is very simple: A really big blaster, welded to a ship with a button to fire it. Even the most basic of Laser cannons nowadays are far more advanced than this, but they have been kept around for a reason. Their use is very widespread, be it anti-starfighter defenses, or the main armaments of a starfighter."
 laser_cannon_technology_2:0 "Improved Laser Cannons"
 laser_cannon_technology_2_desc:0 "Improvements to the fairly basic designs of laser cannons will allow for wider turn angles, faster movement, more precise shots, and even more powerful cannons."
 laser_cannon_technology_3:0 "Advanced Laser Cannons"
 laser_cannon_technology_3_desc:0 "Our most advanced designs yet, these cannons have massively improved firepower over their predecessors. To compensate for this, the cooling system on the cannons have been overhauled, and heat should be less of an issue. As well, expanding the turn angles once again will allow nearly a 360 cone of fire for weapons on ships that support it."
