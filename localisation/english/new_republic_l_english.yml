#Galactic Events
swcw.1.title:0 "Doravalla Incident"
swcw.1.desc:0 "A convoy of peaceful Trade Federation vessels carrying vast amount of Iommite Ore, and a small shipment of extremely valuable Aurodium have been attacked by organised pirates in the Dorvalla system. Estimated to have a value of over 60,000 credits, Viceroy Nute Gungray made an impassioned speech earlier this morning on reforms believed necessary to prevent another attack. Nemodia has made nenewed calls for the relaxing of weapons restrictions imposed by the Russan reformation, as well as an introduction of trade route taxation in the outer rim systems to halt the spread of these pirates. These demands will be heard on the senate floor later this week, in which Chancellor Valorum will comment on the issue."

swcw.2.title:0 "Naboo Crisis Escalates!"
swcw.2.desc:0 "A trade dispute between the galactic trade federation and the Naboo government has culminated in a full-blown blockade of the planet. In a show of weakness for a collapsing Valorum government, the Republic has neglected to dispatch a peacemaker force. Calls have rung throughout the senate for an impromptu election for the position of chancellor, and it'll later come to be in the upcoming months."
swcw.3.title:0 "Valorum Responds"
swcw.3.desc:0 "The Supreme Chancellor's office today announced that steps will be taken over the next week to facilitate a consensus on issues raised by Senator Nute Gungray."
swcw.3.a:0 "A necessary step"
swcw.3.b:0 "A sign of weakness for Valorum"
swcw.12.desc:0 "The Senate chambers filled with loud outcries of protest and dismay yesterday morning following Senator Garm Bel Iblis' surprise announcement that Corellia would close its borders and pull out of the Military Creation Act vote. "The Corellian sector, one of the founding fathers of the Republic, is not seceding," stressed Bel Iblis. "However, Corellia will not participate in what it deems a profound error that threatens its sovereignty." 1/nAfter the announcement, Bel Iblis and his retinue left the Senate Hall under heavily armed CorSec escort who pushed aside journalists and critical Senators. Bel Iblis refused comment. The Senator left Coruscant, reportedly for Corellia."

#Naboo invasion event chain
blockade.1.d:0 "The Royal Queen of Naboo desperately needs the help of the Galactic Republic. The Queen has accused the Trade Federation of illegally blockading, and invading her homeworld. She claims that many of her people are starving and many will die if the Trade Federation is not forced to back down."
blockade.4.d:0 "I will not defer...I have come before you to resolve this attack on our sovereignty now. I was not elected to watch my people suffer and die while you discuss this invasion in a committee. If this body is not capable of action, I suggest new leadership is needed. I move for a vote of no confidence...in Chancellor Valorum's leadership."
blockade.15.d:0 "Finis Valorum has been removed from power and an election has been held in the senate to appoint his successor. Senator Palpatine of Naboo has been chosen as the new Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic."
