#Events
BOT.1:0 "Clan Officials Accepting Bribes"
BOT.1.d:0 "After several months of being the rotating head of government, the clan we put in charge has apparently become intensely corrupt. There are many reports of law enforcement in Drevstarn openly discriminating against Bothans of other clans. Because of this, many Bothans have lost faith in the current government."
BOT.2:0 "Parade Held in Honour of Borsk Fey'la"
BOT.2.d:0 "Borsk Fey'lya of Clan Alya, newly made councillor of Bothawui, has experienced a rapid rise to power throughout the Galactic Civil War period. His courageous leadership both within the Bothan Spynet, the harrowed halls of government on Bothawui, and within the Alliance to Restore the Republic have garnered respect from many Bothans. Today in Drevstarn and in his honour, Bothan delegates organized a parade celebrating the death of the Emperor and the Bothan contribution to the war effort."
BOT.3:0 "Unification Celebrations"
BOT.3.d:0 "Since the first Bothans travelled out into the galaxy, our home planet has ever been divided into its many nation states, ruled by powerful clans. Thankfully, due to the leadership of Councillor Borsk Fey'lya, these troublesome clans have been squashed, and the planet unified!"
BOT.4:0 "Signing of the First Bothan Constitution"
BOT.4.d:0 "Since the first Bothans travelled out into the galaxy, our home planet has ever been divided into its many nation states, ruled by powerful clans. Thankfully, due to the cunning of Councillor Borks Fey'lya, each and every squabbling clan has agreed to sign the Bothan Constitution. This constitution binds the disparate states to one common government tighter than before, though they will still maintain their independence in most matters. A day for celebration!"
BOT.5:0 "Borsk Fey'lya Suffers an Injury"
BOT.5.d:0 "After having been named Commander in Chief of the Bothan army, Councillor Borsk Fey'lya has been taking to the role with bravado. The Bothan press were present at a training exercise which Fey'lya himself took part in, right along the rank and file. Unfortunately, Councillor Fey'lya injured his arm during the drill, and was taken out of commission for the rest of the day's proceedings. He has vowed to continue with his military training very soon."
