 ZER_IMPERIAL_REMNANT_def:0 "the Imperial Remnant"

 ZER_blitzer_harrsk_desc:0 "Blitzer Harrsk was one of the most talented tacticians in the Imperial Navy. During the Battle of Endor, Harrsk suffered a cranial injury resulting in a split personality between Harrsk and his deceased second-in-command Captain Bolla Thoath. Following the destruction of the death star, Harrsk, who was convinced he was Bolla Thoath, initially complied with Captain Gilad Pellaeon's retreat orders. Harrsk later emerged from his second personality and refused to obey orders from such a low rank imperial.\n\nIn the past 2 years since the Emperor was killed, Harrsk has carved out the an empire in the Deep Core using his fleet of modified star destroyers. The self-proclaimed Lord High Admiral Harrsk now looks to expand the influence of the Zero Command and forge a new Empire in the ashes of a dying one."

 ZER_start.2.a:0 "This is madness!"
 ZER_start.2.b:0 "It's simply a security measure."

 ZER.1.t:0 "Zero Command Fleet Modifications?"
 ZER.1.d:0 "Never before has Zero Command faced more external threats! Lord High Admiral Harrsk requires a more powerful fleet in order to protect our territories from potential enemies. We have two feasible options; we could either technologically enhance our current ships, or set about creating an efficient production line for new warships. A technologically advanced fleet enjoys precision in tactics, low losses, and high impact on the battlefield. A larger, standardised fleet enjoys strength in numbers and less material loss when a fleet is destroyed. The choice is up to you commander."
 ZER.1.a:0 "A technologically enhanced fleet will give us the advantage."
 ZER.1.b:0 "Zero Command requires more warships to defend itself."

 ZER.2.t:0 "Robotic Tie Fighters"
 ZER.2.d:0 "Our scientists have been experimenting with robotically assisted Tie Fighters, although they have been extremely effective at targeting enemies and navigating obstacles, the pilots usually have to intervene as the tests have shown but if this technology succeeds, it could give us the edge over our enemy. Final tests will determine whether the technology is battle-ready or not."
 ZER.2.a:0 "I'm hoping for results..."

 ZER.3.t:0 "Testing Failure"
 ZER.3.d:0 "The testing Tie Fighters were unable to pass the course provided by the researchers, the project has been terminated but some valuable experience has been gained by many of the fleet technicians."
 ZER.3.a:0 "It was a crazy idea anyways!"

 ZER.4.t:0 "Testing Success"
 ZER.4.d:0 "Miraculously the tests were all passed by the robotic Tie Fighters, although this technology will not be used to fully control spacecraft it will be implemented in newer models of Tie Fighter to improve the pilot's accuracy and provide a competent autopilot."
 ZER.4.a:0 "Let's hope our enemies don't find this."

 ZER.5.t:0 "Shockwave Battle-ready"
 ZER.5.d:0 "Shockwave has been completely sealed with all new additions fixed to the warship. The destroyer must go through a series of inspections before being implemented. Lord High Admiral Harrsk is elated with the completion of this project and is keen to unveil the machine of war to the public."
 ZER.5.a:0 "Excellent!"

 ZER.6.t:0 "Shockwave Revealed to the Public"
 ZER.6.d:0 "The technologically advanced star destroyer Shockwave was revealed to the public today amidst a military parade. The behemoth of a warship hovered peacefully in the sky above rows of marching stormtroopers. Looks of amazement and astonishment were seen on the citizens's faces as they looked up to such a sight."
 ZER.6.a:0 "A most powerful weapon."

 ZER.7.t:0 "Tie Fighter Malfunctions"
 ZER.7.d:0 "The Tie Fighter was designed by the Empire as an efficient starfighter. Featuring no hyperdrive and minimal life support, the design of the fighter is barebones at best. Our pilots have routinely been victims of malfunctions, impairing them in the heat of battle. Only recently a skirmish took place between Zero Command forces and a small band of smugglers. What should have been an easy victory turned to a humiliation as one of the pilot's Tie Fighter malfunctioned causing a collision with most of his wingmates. We must resolve these issues if we intend to use these fighters en masse in future conflicts."
 ZER.7.a:0 "It's time to get to work."

 ZER_start.12.d:0 "Blitzer Harrsk, the first Imperial warlord, has come to our nation to garner our support. He proposes a military alliance with the intent of uniting the Imperial factions once more. Although the self-proclaimed Lord High Admiral has noble intentions, it may be unwise to join forces with Harrsk without guarantees of independence.\n\nThe High Command of Zero Command has offered protection and support in our future wars in exchange for our support in their goal to retake the galaxy against the rebel threat."
 ZER_start.12.a:0 "A worthy cause!"
 ZER_start.12.b:0 "It is too dangerous."

 ZER_news.1.t:0 "Harrsk declares himself Lord High Admiral"
 ZER_news.1.d:0 "Blitzer Harrsk, leader of the Imperial splinter faction Zero Command has announced that he has been promoted to Lord High Admiral. He intends to use this new position to grow the influence of Zero Command throughout the inner core. Many imperial and rebel leaders are skeptical of the legitimacy of this promotion, including Leia Organa who stated that she suspects he gave the rank to himself. Despite the strange rank that Harrsk has been promoted to, celebrations have erupted on Zero Command's capital world of Kalist VI and there has been a surge in popular support for the warlord."
 ZER_news.1.a:0 "A worthy title."
 ZER_news.1.b:0 "Lord High Admiral?"

 ZER_news.2.t:0 "Blitzer Harrsk becomes Emperor!"
 ZER_news.2.desc:0 "Emperor [?global.previous_emperor.GetLeader] of the former Galactic Empire has been deposed! Lord High Admiral Blitzer Harrsk has risen in support until his power outweighed that of [?global.previous_emperor.GetLeader]. Harrsk vows to restore the Empire to its former might no matter the cost. He promises death to the rebellion and any who sympathise with them. Emperor Blitzer Harrsk announced that Zero Command and a collection of other loyal warlords would be reorganised into the Imperial Remnant with the goal of retaking the former capital of the Galactic Empire on Coruscant. The new Emperor states that only once the rebellion has been exterminated from Coruscant can a new Galactic Empire be established."
 ZER_news.2.a:0 "Death to the rebel scum!"
 ZER_news.2.b:0 "Harrsk is a fool."

 ZER_start.8.t:0 "Matters of National Security in Abregado Rae"
 ZER_start.8.d:0 "With the surrender of Abregado Rae’s planetary government, it seems that insurgents from other parts of the galaxy have encouraged the populace to rebel against our new government. Although the occupation of the planet is in its infancy, if left unchecked, the insurgency problem may become a future issue.\n\nCentral command has provided two strategies for defending our interests on Abregado Rae. The first dictates that we defend the main cities and areas that sustain our forces on the planet, this would protect our areas of interest but would give way for rebellion to grow in areas that are not being defended by our forces. The second strategy is a methodical sweep of the planet for insurgents and a large contingent of imperial soldiers and stormtroopers on the planet to prevent future rebellion. Although the second option would most likely deal with the resistance problem quickly, large quantities of equipment and manpower would be needed to deal with the issue. Alternatively we could also install a small garrison and leave the resistance cells to subsist over time."
 ZER_start.8.a:0 "Defend our interests on the planet."
 ZER_start.8.b:0 "Crush the rebels now!"
 ZER_start.8.c:0 "We must preserve our resources."

 ZER_start.9.t:0 "Attack on Weapons Depot"
 ZER_start.9.d:0 "Rebels on Abregado Rae have assaulted one of our weapons depots, the facility has been severely damaged and countless weapons have been lost to these insurgents. We must crack down on the resistance immediately."
 ZER_start.9.a:0 "Rebel scum."

 ZER_start.10.t:0 "Large Scale Uprising"
 ZER_start.10.d:0 "Rebellion has sparked in Abregado Rae! Although not escalated to a full military conflict, the workers of factories in the cities of Abregado Rae have striked against their factory managers and have begun destroying equipment and pursuing lone imperial officers. This insolence must not be tolerated, the high command suggests that we kill every one of them."
 ZER_start.10.a:0 "They will be dealt with in due time."

 ZER_start.11.t:0 "Harrsk convenes with High Command"
 ZER_start.11.d:0 "Blitzer Harrsk walks into the strategic room on the upper deck of his flagship Tector-class Star Destroyer. His high command and strategic advisors are present in the room in their imperial officer uniforms. The air in the room is tense as the officers know the decision Harrsk is about to announce, a few officers had even placed bets on Harrsk’s decisions.\n\nThe Lord High Admiral of Zero Command sits in the tall leather seat at the end of the strategic room’s conference table. He places his datapad on the table, clears his voice and says ‘Thank you my most loyal soldiers, paladins of Imperial faith, protectors of peace and order. Today I have made a decision, for better or for worse, I believe it is in the best interest of Zero Command.’\n\nTension rose in the room as Harrsk prepared to announce his decision: ‘It is time to gear for war! Zero Command will pursue its goal…’"
 ZER_start.11.a:0 "...of forging a new Galactic Empire!"
 ZER_start.11.b:0 "...of creating our own protectorate."

 ZER_reversal_of_fates_desc:0 "Zero Command, being the first ‘warlord’ kingdom to form in the wake of the Emperor’s death, is an odd contender to the Imperial throne. Many Imperial factions may not believe our intentions and distrust sown by Harrsk in the months after the Emperor’s death will complicate our ascension to Emperor."

 ZER_spreading_propaganda_desc:0 "Blitzer Harrsk is not the most popular Imperial officer in the galaxy, far from it in actuality. We must garner the support of the people! If Imperial citizens view Harrsk as the Empire’s saviour, the Imperial officer who can defend the Core worlds from the Rebel threat, then his influence will not only grow in our territory but around the galaxy."

 ZER_legitimacy_with_power_desc:0 "While the support behind Harrsk in his quest to become emperor is insignificant, we have other ways of garnering support. The Empire, in its struggle against the rebelscum, is unable to contend with the large armies of the New Republic. To unite the Imperial factions we must maintain a strong military, one capable of defending our territory from the New Republic."
